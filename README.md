 Welcome to my topical solana blockchain space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. This is where I work on Solana-based smart contracts,
	. and any associated frontend and sdk dApp stuff
. As something matures, I may migrate it somewhere more structured.
. There is a DUMP here for processing.
. There are some working logs and miscellany
. An idea will live in it's own directory,
	. until it matures into its own repo, or not.
